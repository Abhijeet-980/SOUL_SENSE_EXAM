## 🧩 Question Format

Each question is rated on a 4-point Likert scale:

- Never (1)
- Sometimes (2)
- Often (3)
- Always (4)

### Sample Questions

- You can recognize your emotions as they happen.
- You adapt well to changing situations.
- You actively listen to others when they speak.

## 🐍 Setting Up a Virtual Environment & Installing Packages

It’s recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep your project dependencies isolated from your system Python.

1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment  
From your project root directory:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a `venv/` folder inside your project.

2️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

When active, your terminal prompt will show `(venv)`.

3️⃣ Install Required Packages

Once activated, install your project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!--4️⃣ Save Dependencies (Optional but Recommended)

Freeze installed packages to a `requirements.txt` file:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Later, to replicate the environment on another machine:
pip install -r requirements.txt -->

> Always **activate the virtual environment** before running scripts or installing new packages.

✅ Tip: If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, it usually means your virtual environment is **not active** or the package isn’t installed inside it.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Database Setup

Ensure your database schema is up to date:

```bash
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Start the Application

Launch the SoulSense interface:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

> **Note:** Do not use `npm run dev`. This is a pure Python application.

**Authentication Flow:**

1. **First-time users:** Click "Sign Up" to create an account

   - Choose a username (minimum 3 characters)
   - Set a password (minimum 4 characters)
   - Confirm your password

2. **Returning users:** Enter your username and password to login

3. **During the test:** Use the logout button to switch users or exit securely

**Security Features:**

- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 encryption
- User sessions are managed securely
- Each user's data is isolated and protected

## 🧪 Running Tests

From the project root:

```bash
    python -m pytest -v
```

Tests use temporary SQLite databases and do not affect production data.

### Running Outlier Detection Tests

```bash
    python -m pytest tests/test_outlier_detection.py -v
```

---

## 📊 Outlier Detection Feature

### Overview

The outlier detection module identifies extreme or inconsistent emotional intelligence scores using advanced statistical methods.

**Supported Methods:**
- **Z-Score**: Identifies scores deviating significantly from mean
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: Robust method for skewed distributions
- **Modified Z-Score**: Uses median/MAD for robustness
- **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)**: Resistant to extreme values
- **Ensemble**: Consensus-based approach combining multiple methods

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Analyze user scores
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --user john_doe --method ensemble

# Analyze age group
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --age-group "18-25" --method iqr

# Global analysis
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --global --method zscore

# Check inconsistency patterns
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --inconsistency john_doe --days 30

# Get statistics
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --stats --age-group "26-35"

# Output as JSON
python scripts/outlier_analysis.py --user john_doe --format json
```

### Python API

```python
from app.db import get_session
from app.outlier_detection import OutlierDetector

detector = OutlierDetector()
session = get_session()

# Detect outliers for user
result = detector.detect_outliers_for_user(session, "john_doe", method="ensemble")

# Detect by age group
result = detector.detect_outliers_by_age_group(session, "18-25", method="iqr")

# Global analysis
result = detector.detect_outliers_global(session, method="zscore")

# Inconsistency analysis
result = detector.detect_inconsistency_patterns(session, "john_doe", time_window_days=30)
```

---

## 🧱 Design Notes

- Database schemas are created and migrated safely at runtime
- Question loading is idempotent and separated from application logic
- Core logic is decoupled from the GUI to enable testing
- Outlier detection uses NumPy for efficient statistical computations
- All methods are fully tested with comprehensive edge case coverage

## 📌 Status

- Refactor complete
- Tests added
- Stable baseline for further enhancements (e.g., decorators, generators)
