# Ethical Considerations for Emotional Data and AI Predictions

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the ethical principles followed in the SOUL_SENSE_EXAM project when collecting, processing, storing, and analyzing emotional data. Since emotional and mental well-being data is sensitive, special care is taken to ensure responsible use, transparency, and user protection.

---

## 2. Nature of Emotional Data

The application may collect the following types of data:

- Responses to emotional intelligence (EQ) questions
- Emotional journal entries written by users
- Derived scores or insights generated from user input

This data is considered sensitive because it reflects personal feelings, emotional states, and mental well-being.

---

## 3. User Consent and Transparency

- Users should be clearly informed about what data is collected and why.
- Data collection should occur only after the user voluntarily provides input.
- The purpose of emotional analysis and score generation must be explained in simple language.
- Users should understand that AI-generated insights are informational and not medical advice.

---

## 4. Purpose Limitation

Emotional data is used only for:

- Calculating EQ scores
- Providing self-awareness insights
- Improving user understanding of emotional patterns

The data is **not** used for:
- Medical diagnosis
- Automated decision-making with legal or personal consequences
- Commercial profiling or targeted advertising

---

## 5. Data Minimization

- Only data strictly necessary for application functionality is collected.
- Optional features (such as emotional journaling) do not require mandatory participation.
- No unnecessary personal identifiers are required.

---

## 6. Data Storage and Security

- Emotional data is stored locally in a secure SQLite database.
- Access to stored data is restricted to the application logic.
- Developers should avoid logging sensitive emotional content in plain text.
- Data should be deleted upon user request or when no longer required.

---

## 7. AI Predictions and Limitations

- AI-generated insights and predictions are based on predefined rules or models, not clinical evaluation.
- Results may be approximate and influenced by user input quality.
- Predictions should always be presented as guidance, not absolute truths.
- The system must clearly state that it does not replace mental health professionals.

---

## 8. Bias and Fairness

- Questionnaires and scoring logic should be designed to avoid cultural, gender, or social bias.
- Developers should periodically review questions and interpretations for fairness.
- Feedback mechanisms should exist to report misleading or uncomfortable outputs.

---

## 9. Psychological Safety

- Language used in insights should be neutral, supportive, and non-judgmental.
- Avoid alarming, negative, or deterministic statements about a user’s emotional state.
- Encourage seeking professional help if distress is indicated, without forcing conclusions.

---

## 10. User Control and Data Rights

Users should have the ability to:
- View their stored emotional data
- Request deletion of their data
- Stop using the application without penalty

Clear instructions for data deletion should be documented in the repository.

---

## 11. Responsible Development Practices

Developers contributing to this project should:
- Treat emotional data with confidentiality and respect
- Avoid experimenting with user data without consent
- Follow ethical AI and data protection best practices
- Document changes that affect data handling or AI logic

## 12. Disclaimer

SOUL_SENSE_EXAM is an educational and self-reflection tool.  
It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or replace professional mental health services.

## 13. Conclusion

Ethical handling of emotional data is central to the SOUL_SENSE_EXAM project. By prioritizing transparency, consent, fairness, and user well-being, the application aims to provide meaningful insights while respecting user dignity and privacy.
